<h1>Frank Albie Website</h1>
<p><i>An ecommerce webiste made for my client, Frank Albie. </i> </p>

<p> Frank Albie is a small brand run by textile artist Gina Davey. She needed a small ecommerce webiste where she could sell totes and pillowcovers made from textiles she had designed and manufactured. </n>

The website is built using React, Sanity CMS, and a bit of Bootstrap and a lot of CSS.</n>

It was created as a final project at the end of my first year of study. </n>
I connected the app to Sanity to fetch all of the product data, and I created a funtional shopping cart which sent Gina an email of the products purchased. </n>

I have continued working on the project using Commerce.js and Stripe in a seperate repo, but this version does not support payment.
